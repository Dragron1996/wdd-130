        <p> Who is Franko?- Franco and his family came from Peru. He came from very humble beginings, but overtime he has grown to become the man he is. During his studies in Peru he learn the gift of laughter and learn he had a natural gift of bringing joy to others.

He started to hone his craft daily and since then he decided to come to America to not only bring joy to those in the U.S., but to change the lives of his family. </p>
