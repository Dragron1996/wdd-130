      <h2>
        Content
      </h2>
      <h3>Home page</h3>
      <p>
        Overall the website for my friend Franco will have a detail information about what he does and who he is. The basis of both the main and secondary pages will be to expand the viewers information of my friend Franco. Since the product of the page will be him it is only fitting that the view, or the customer, would want to know more about Franco before investing time into watching him. Also if the customer is a huge fan of his then it is even more welcoming for them to know more about him. Since being a comedian is very focused on getting a fan based then one goal is to get Franco's name out there. So, a big thing is to be able to connect to his social media. Each page will have connections to his social media in one way or another. 
        The main page will be focus on advertising Franco and some of his accomplishments and what others have said about him. The main page will have images of him while performing and also some reviews of his performance. You will also see some words that will describe franco in a positive light. Another main focus of the main page is to attract the eyes of the viewers by focusing what is pleasing to the eyes. One big thing for the main page would be to highlight his social media. Since Franco will want to be connect with his audience and fans this page will also high light how other people have joined his social media and others should join also. I will have mulitple examples of what others have said and comment on his social media. Since being a fan is important and Franco would like to treat his fan's like family there will be a Fan of the month that would show up on the website.

      </ul>
      <h3>About Franco</h3>
      <p>
        The first child page will be mainly focuings on explain Franco's life. This will be made so people that are interested on who Franco is can relate to him in a more personal setting. He won't be just another random face on stage, but someone that is down to earth and normal in his own ways. There will also be a FAQ for Franco this will highlights some common questions his customers has for him and also if any choose to email him will have a link or a location to do it so they can contact him in their own ways. Franco social media will be brought up in this section, but it won't be too much of a major point. It will basically say "If you want to get to know Franco more come and join the conversations on his social media!" This would be done in a more low key way since his main page will have already highlighted his social media already and to double down on it on his about page would just draw customers away. Also his about page would be a bit more laid back and more informative than advertisement.

      </ul>
      <h3>Where's Franco</h3>
      <p>
        The second will be more like a blog and an update on where Franco is currently performing and will be performing. It will also have Franco's current thoughts about the cities and what's going through his mind. It will be kinda like a one way social media account. This is made for Franco's fans to go to website to learn who he is currently and what's on his mind. Franco will also talk about and highlight certain fans he has seen and explain why certain people have become fan of the month. Franco social media will again become relevant because since this is a blog like structure we will add things like" To continue to conversation comment on Franco's social media" It will be something that will be less flashy as his main page but more than his about me page. The Where's Franco site will also show Franco's future sites or events so if people are really into Franco's acts then they can go and pre plan any trips they might have to watch Franco. There may also be some examples of jokes that may be brought up, so if someone really like a certain joke they can go to the events that uses that joke.
