    <h2>Jason Nguyen</h2>
    <p>This is my first paragraph that I have made with HTML. I'm extited to learn more about
        in general. I start to major in Computer Science. I decided to go in Computer Science because 
    I notice all the advancements in the industry and potentional for growth.  </p>
    <p>Besides Computer Science I also have a few hobbies. One of the hobbies I'm trying to get into is MMA. I'm not good 
        right now by any mean, but it's something I have fun doing. 
    </p>
    <p>One of the biggest things I hope to gain with this new degree is the ability to work from home. Theres are times I'm amazed at how much time
        I spent just on the road going to and from work. I hope to get to know you all and I'll see you guys in class
